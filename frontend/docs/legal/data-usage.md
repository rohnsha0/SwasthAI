# Data Usage

At SwasthAI, we prioritize the privacy and security of our users' data. This document outlines our data usage practices and how we handle user information.

## On-Device Processing

All scan-related processes are performed on-device, ensuring that no data is sent to or stored on the cloud without explicit user consent. We understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information and take appropriate measures to protect it.

## Cloud Storage

Unless explicitly opted for verification using third-party services like ChatGPT, we do not store any user data on the cloud. This means that your personal information and scan results are not saved or accessible by anyone other than yourself.

## Community Posts

In order to foster a collaborative environment, we allow users to create community posts. These posts, along with the author's username, are stored on our servers. However, we do not collect any additional data from these posts, ensuring that your privacy is respected.

## Data Security

We employ industry-standard security measures to safeguard your data. This includes encryption, access controls, and regular security audits to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration of your information.

## Consent and Control

We believe in giving users full control over their data. You have the right to opt in or out of any data collection or storage processes. Additionally, you can delete your community posts at any time.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our data usage practices, please contact our support team.
